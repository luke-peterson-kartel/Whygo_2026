# WhyGO Framework - Complete Methodology

## What are WhyGOs?

WhyGO is a company-wide goal system that creates alignment against top priorities for the year.

**WhyGO stands for:**
- **Why** - Why the goal exists (strategic context)
- **Goal** - What we are trying to achieve (objective)
- **Outcome** - How we measure success (metrics)

## How WhyGOs Differ from OKRs

| Aspect | OKRs | WhyGOs |
|--------|------|--------|
| Reset frequency | Quarterly | Annual |
| Grading | Complex grading system | Simple: [+] [~] [-] |
| Compensation | Typically disconnected | Directly tied to bonuses |
| Constraints | Flexible number | Maximum 3 per entity |
| Context | Key results only | Requires explicit WHY |

---

## WhyGO Structure

### 1. WHY Statement
A short summary (3 sentences or less) explaining:
- Why this goal was chosen
- Strategic context connecting to higher-level priorities
- What happens if we don't achieve it

**Example:**
> "Enterprise clients require custom AI models and workflows to achieve 100% brand accuracy - generic tools only deliver 70%. Proving our Creative Intelligence Infrastructure works across multiple verticals demonstrates market demand, validates our thesis, and creates referenceable case studies for growth."

### 2. GOAL Statement
Clear, specific objective with:
- What will be different by year end
- Timeframe (typically EOY or specific quarter)
- Owner identified

**Example:**
> "Onboard 10 enterprise clients across 5 key verticals by end of Q2 2026, establishing Kartel as the category leader in Creative Intelligence Infrastructure."

### 3. OUTCOMES (2-3 per goal)
Measurable results that prove goal achievement:
- Specific number, percentage, date, or yes/no
- Quarterly pacing (Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4 targets)
- Single owner per outcome

**Example:**
| Outcome | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Owner |
|---------|----|----|----|----|-------|
| Enterprise clients signed | 4 | 10 | 14 | 18+ | Ben |
| Verticals with 2+ clients | 2 | 5 | 5 | 5 | Kevin |
| Case studies published | 1 | 3 | 4 | 5 | Marketing |

## WhyGO Rules (Non-Negotiable)

### Rule 1: Three or Less
- Maximum 3 WhyGOs per entity (company, department, individual)
- Forces focus on top priorities
- If you have 4+ candidates, prioritize ruthlessly
- Less is more

### Rule 2: Challenging but Realistic
- Not stretch goals (unrealistic)
- Not sandbagged goals (too easy)
- Aim to hit 100% of the goal
- CEO sets difficulty with Board approval

### Rule 3: Strong WHY Required
- Every goal needs strategic context
- Three sentences or less
- Explains connection to higher-level goals
- Answers "why does this matter?"

### Rule 4: Measurable Outcomes
- Every outcome must be quantifiable
- Numbers, percentages, dates, or clear yes/no
- If all outcomes achieved, goal must be achieved
- Maximum 3 outcomes per goal

### Rule 5: Company Goals = CEO Goals
- CEO owns company-level goals
- Simplifies accountability
- CEO compensation tied to company performance
- No separate CEO goals

### Rule 6: Must Ladder Up
- Department goals connect to Company goals
- Individual goals connect to Department goals
- Every goal should move higher-level outcomes
- No orphan goals
