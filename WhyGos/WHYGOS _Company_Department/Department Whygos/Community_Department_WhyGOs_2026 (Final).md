# Executive Summary

The Community & Partnerships Department is the talent acquisition engine that enables Kartel to scale without linear headcount growth. In 2026, the department will focus on two strategic priorities:

- Talent Engine: Build a 1,000+ member Discord community with a gamified 5-tier pipeline that certifies and delivers 20 qualified generative artists ready for pod deployment by EOY. This is cheaper than recruiting, faster than hiring, and creates a talent moat competitors cannot replicate.

- Community System Performance: Operate a high-performing community system with strong engagement, efficient tier progression, and high platform utilization. Tracking system health ensures we're building a sustainable pipeline, not a vanity metric.

These WhyGOs ladder directly to Company WhyGO #3 (Build the Talent Engine). Success in the Community & Partnerships Department unlocks Kartel's ability to deploy pods to enterprise clients without competing for scarce full-time talent in the market.

Key Dependencies: Success depends on Fill's Community Ecosystem Platform MVP (Q1) and Lighthouse partnership finalization (Q1). Cross-functional alignment is in place.

# Company WhyGO Alignment

| Department WhyGO | Ladders To | Connection |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #1: Talent Engine | Company #3 (Build the Talent Engine) | Strong |
| #2: Community System Performance | Company #3 (Build the Talent Engine) | Strong |

# WhyGO #1: Talent Engine

WHY

Kartel scales by deploying complete pods to enterprise clients—not by hiring full-time headcount for every new engagement. Creative engineering talent barely exists in the market; the few people with these skills are expensive and hard to recruit. A gamified community with clear progression paths lets us identify, train, and certify top generative talent at scale. Daniel provides qualified talent; Fill onboards and deploys them. This is cheaper than recruiting, faster than hiring, and creates a talent moat competitors can't replicate.

GOAL

Build a 1,000+ member Discord community with a gamified 5-tier pipeline that certifies and delivers 20 qualified generative artists ready for pod deployment by EOY.

OUTCOMES

| Outcome | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 (Annual) | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Discord community members | 300 | 500 | 750 | 1,000 | Daniel |
| Qualified talent ready for pod deployment (Tier 5) | 5 | 12 | 20 | 20 | Daniel |
| Lighthouse certification live (4 role tracks) | Setup | Live | Iterate | Optimized | Daniel |
| Sponsored community events (Prompetitions, brand challenges) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4+ | Daniel |

## 5-Tier Talent Pipeline

| Tier | Status | Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tier 1 | Community Member | Joined Discord, completed onboarding |
| Tier 2 | Engaged Learner | Completed foundational training modules, active in community |
| Tier 3 | Skill Verified | Passed technical assessment in one or more role tracks |
| Tier 4 | Trial Contributor | Completed supervised trial project with quality review |
| Tier 5 | Approved Kartel Talent | Actively deployed on client work, meets Kartel quality standards |

Role Tracks: Workflow Engineer | AI Generalist | Data Specialist | Training Specialist | Preditor

# WhyGO #2: Community System Performance

WHY

The Talent Engine only works if the community is active, engaged, and progressing. A Discord with 1,000 members means nothing if they're not participating. Tracking system health—engagement rates, tier progression velocity, and platform usage—ensures we're building a sustainable pipeline, not a vanity metric.

GOAL

Operate a high-performing community system with strong weekly engagement, efficient tier progression, and high platform utilization.

OUTCOMES

| Outcome | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Active member rate (weekly engagement) | Baseline | TBD | TBD | TBD | Daniel |
| Tier progression velocity (Tier 1 → Tier 4) | Baseline | TBD | TBD | TBD | Daniel |
| Generation credits utilized | Baseline | TBD | TBD | TBD | Daniel |

Note: Daniel to propose Q2-Q4 targets by end of Q1 once baseline data is established.

# Addendum A: Cross-Departmental Dependencies

The Community & Partnerships Department does not operate in isolation. Success depends on coordination with Generative, Platform, and Sales. This section maps the critical dependencies and handoffs.

## Dependencies ON Community (What Others Need From Daniel's Team)

| Department | Dependency | Daniel Delivers | Timeline |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Generative (Fill) | Qualified talent for pod deployment | Tier 5 certified talent (20 by EOY) | 5 Q1, 12 Q2, 20 Q3+ |
| Executive (Kevin/Luke) | Pipeline visibility for scaling decisions | Community metrics dashboard, tier funnel data | Monthly |
| Sales (Ben) | Proof of talent moat for enterprise pitches | Community stats, success stories | On-demand |

## Dependencies FROM Community (What Daniel's Team Needs From Others)

| Department | Dependency | Deliverable Needed | Success Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Generative (Fill) | Community Ecosystem Platform | Credits, challenges, tier tracking MVP | Live by end of Q1 |
| Platform (Niels) | Platform infrastructure | Backend for credits, submissions, badges | Live by end of Q1 |
| Generative (Fill) | Role playbooks for certification | Documented standards for each role track | Q1-Q2 |
| External | Lighthouse partnership | Certification platform integration | Finalized Q1 |

## Talent Engine Handoff: Daniel → Fill

Company WhyGO #3 requires 20 Tier 5 Approved Kartel Talent deployed on client work by EOY. This outcome depends on clear handoff between Community and Generative:

| Stage | Owner | Responsibility | Success Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tiers 1-4 | Daniel (Community) | Recruit, train, certify talent to role-specific standards | Talent passes challenges, completes Lighthouse certification |
| Tier 4→5 Handoff | Daniel + Fill | Qualified talent matched to open pod roles | Talent assigned to specific pod/role |
| Tier 5 | Fill (Generative) | Deploy, manage, maximize output | Talent producing client work at quality standards |

Fill's role playbooks enable this handoff. Without documented roles and certification standards, Daniel can't certify talent to the right standards, and Fill can't onboard them efficiently.

# Addendum B: Strategic Context

## The Talent Moat Thesis

Creative engineering—the skill of building custom AI workflows on custom-trained data—barely exists as a job category. The people who can do this work are rare, expensive, and don't respond to traditional recruiting. Kartel's community strategy solves this problem by:

- Attracting talent with generation credits, challenges, and community engagement

- Training them through structured curriculum and Lighthouse certification

- Filtering for quality through progressive tier requirements

- Deploying them on client work when they reach Tier 5

This is cheaper than recruiting (no agency fees), faster than hiring (pre-trained talent), and creates a moat competitors can't replicate (our community, our standards, our pipeline).

## Community Economics

| Comparison | Traditional Hiring | Kartel Talent Engine |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Time to deploy | 8-12 weeks (recruit + onboard) | 1-2 weeks (already trained) |
| Acquisition cost | $15-30K (recruiter fees) | Platform cost only |
| Training investment | Kartel bears 100% | Talent self-selects + community trains |
| Scaling flexibility | Fixed headcount | Deploy as needed per engagement |

# Addendum C: Implementation Guide

## Q1 Priorities

Q1 is the foundation quarter. Critical deliverables:

| # | Deliverable | WhyGO | Deadline |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Discord community reaches 300 members | #1 | End of Q1 |
| 2 | 5 Tier 5 talent deployed on client work | #1 | End of Q1 |
| 3 | Lighthouse certification partnership finalized | #1 | End of Q1 |
| 4 | 1 sponsored community event (Prompetition or brand challenge) | #1 | End of Q1 |
| 5 | Community Ecosystem Platform MVP live (with Fill + Niels) | #1 + #2 | End of Q1 |
| 6 | Baseline established for engagement, tier velocity, credit utilization | #2 | End of Q1 |

## Progress Tracking

Use these indicators in weekly/monthly reviews:

| Indicator | Meaning | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [+] | On pace (100% of target) | Continue current approach |
| [~] | Slightly off-pace (within 20%) | Identify blockers, adjust tactics |
| [-] | Off-pace (more than 20% behind) | Escalate to leadership, reallocate resources |
