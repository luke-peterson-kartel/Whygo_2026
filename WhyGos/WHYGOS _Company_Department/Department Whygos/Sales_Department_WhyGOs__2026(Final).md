## Executive Summary

The Sales Department is the revenue engine that proves Kartel's product-market fit. In 2026, the department will focus on three strategic priorities:

1. Land Enterprise Clients Across Verticals: Sign 18+ enterprise spec engagements across 5 key verticals (CPG, Auto, Beauty/Fashion, eComm, Real Estate), convert 75%+ to paying clients, and close $7M in revenue. Client count and vertical diversity prove the thesis; revenue proves the business model.

2. Build Client Success Engine: Achieve 50+ NPS, publish 5 case studies, and retain 90%+ of clients past the spec period. If clients aren't successful and referenceable, PMF isn't proven—it's just revenue.

3. Build Scalable Sales Operations: Grow from a 2-person team to 4-5 with SVP of Sales and Account Managers. Establish handoff discipline with Production and deliver reliable pipeline forecasting to Executive team.

These WhyGOs ladder directly to Company WhyGOs #1 (Prove Product-Market Fit) and #2 (Build Operational Excellence). Success in Sales unlocks Kartel's ability to demonstrate market demand, validate the 70% Problem thesis, and build the foundation for Series A fundraising.

## Company WhyGO Alignment

| Department WhyGO | Ladders To | Connection |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #1: Land Enterprise Clients | Company #1 (PMF) | Primary |
| #2: Build Client Success Engine | Company #1 (PMF) + #2 (Ops) | Strong |
| #3: Build Scalable Sales Ops | Company #2 (Ops Excellence) | Strong |

## WhyGO #1: Land Enterprise Clients Across Verticals

| WHY
PMF requires proving Kartel works for different industries. Client count and vertical diversity demonstrate market demand; revenue proves the business model works. We need to close $7M in 2026 while covering 5 key verticals with referenceable clients. Every new client validates the 70% Problem thesis and creates proof points for the next deal. Spec engagements (unpaid) still deliver value—they allow other teams to build use cases and discover capacity limits. |
| --- |

| GOAL
Sign 18+ enterprise spec engagements across 5 verticals, convert 75%+ to paying clients, and close $7M in revenue by end of 2026. |
| --- |

### OUTCOMES

| Outcome | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spec engagements signed | 4 | 10 | 14 | 18+ | Ben |
| Paying clients (post-spec) | — | 3 | 8 | 14+ | Ben |
| Verticals with 2+ paying clients | — | 2 | 4 | 5 | Ben |
| Revenue closed | $1.5M | $3.5M | $5.5M | $7M | Ben |

## WhyGO #2: Build Client Success Engine

| WHY
Retention and expansion are cheaper than acquisition. NPS proves value to prospects and investors. Case studies are sales ammunition. If clients aren't successful and referenceable, PMF isn't proven—it's just revenue. Client success starts in the 2-month spec period and compounds through the full engagement. |
| --- |

| GOAL
Achieve 50+ NPS, publish 5 case studies, and retain 90%+ of clients past the spec period into full agreements. |
| --- |

### OUTCOMES

| Outcome | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Client NPS Score | Baseline | 40+ | 45+ | 50+ | Ben |
| Case studies published | 1 | 3 | 4 | 5 | Ben |
| Client retention (post-spec) | Baseline | 80%+ | 85%+ | 90%+ | Ben |

NPS measurement method: Ben + Wayan to align by end of Q1

## WhyGO #3: Build Scalable Sales Operations

| WHY
Sales can't scale on hero effort with a 2-person team. To hit 18+ clients and $7M, we need to build the team—SVP of Sales to lead, Account Managers to own client relationships (each AM can handle 2x the clients a Producer can). Clean handoffs protect margin and client trust. Accurate pipeline reporting enables Production capacity planning and Executive decision-making. |
| --- |

| GOAL
Build a sales team capable of scaling to 18+ clients, establish handoff discipline with Production, and deliver reliable pipeline forecasting to Executive team. |
| --- |

### OUTCOMES

| Outcome | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sales team built | SVP search | SVP + 1 AM | +1 AM | 4-5 total | Ben |
| Handoff compliance | 80% | 90% | 95% | 100% | Ben |
| Pipeline report to Exec | Live | Live | ±20% | ±15% | Ben |
