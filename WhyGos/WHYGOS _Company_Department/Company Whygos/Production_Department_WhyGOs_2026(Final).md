# Executive Summary

Production is the proof layer. Sales can promise. Platform can exist. Generative can build. But Production is where clients experience the company. If Production fails, PMF cannot be proven, operational excellence is theoretical, and case studies never materialize.

The Production Department has three strategic priorities for 2026:

- Scale Through Disciplined Handoffs: Establish platform-tracked handoff systems across Sales→Production→Generative→Sales that scale from 6 to 20 active client engagements.

- Deliver Premier Client Experience: Achieve 50% production margin, 90%+ on-time delivery against workflow SLAs, and growing client platform engagement.

- Scale Production Capacity With Revenue: Add Producers proportional to revenue growth while discovering the sustainable client-to-producer ratio (target 4:1).

These WhyGOs ladder directly to Company WhyGOs #1 (Product-Market Fit), #2 (Operational Excellence), and #4 (Enterprise Platform). Production exists to scale Kartel from a high-touch boutique operation to an enterprise-grade delivery engine without breaking quality, margin, or trust.

# Company WhyGO Alignment

| Department WhyGO | Ladders To | Connection |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #1: Scale Through Disciplined Handoffs | Company #1 + #4 | Strong |
| #2: Deliver Premier Client Experience | Company #2 | Strong |
| #3: Scale Production Capacity With Revenue | Company #1 + #2 | Strong |

# WhyGO #1: Scale Through Disciplined Handoffs

WHY

Production is the connective tissue between Sales promises, Generative execution, and client outcomes. Every client engagement lives or dies on four handoffs: (1) Sales closes, Production scopes in the platform; (2) Production requests pod resources from Generative; (3) Generative delivers back to Production for client; (4) Production delivers Closing Report to Sales for NPS, re-engagement, and case study creation. These handoffs must be tracked in the Production Platform—not Slack, not email, not tribal knowledge. We cannot scale to 20 clients without handoff discipline. We cannot win without them.

GOAL

Establish and enforce a platform-tracked handoff system that scales Production from 6 to 20 active client engagements with measurable compliance across all four handoffs.

OUTCOMES

| Outcome | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Active client engagements | 6-8 | 12 | 16 | 20 | Wayan |
| Handoff #1 Compliance (Sales→Prod) | 80% | 90% | 95% | 100% | Wayan + Ben |
| Handoff #2 Compliance (Prod→Gen) | 80% | 90% | 95% | 100% | Wayan |
| Handoff #3 Compliance (Gen→Prod) | 80% | 90% | 95% | 100% | Wayan + Fill |
| Handoff #4: Closing Reports delivered | 80% | 90% | 95% | 100% | Wayan |
| Case study packages delivered | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8+ | Wayan |
| Avg. onboarding time (SOW → pod) | 21 days | 17 days | 14 days | 14 days | Wayan |

## The Four Handoff Cycle (Platform-Tracked)

| Handoff #1 | Handoff #2 | Handoff #3 | Handoff #4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sales → Production | Production → Generative | Generative → Production | Production → Sales |
| SOW signed, scoped in platform | Pod request with specs | QC-passed deliverables | Closing Report delivered |
| Milestones, Timeline, Staffing plan, Budget | Pod roles, Timeline, Deliverable specs, Brand context | QC-passed assets, Submitted in platform | Margin data, Case study visuals, Use cases for Sales |

Sales then: Gets NPS from client, re-engages for expansion, closes the feedback loop.

Platform Dependency: Production Management MVP must be fully in use by Q1 (almost finished, fine-tuning only). Handoff discipline cannot be enforced without tooling.

# WhyGO #2: Deliver Premier Client Experience

WHY

Kartel's business model depends on clients continuously requesting jobs through the platform. We charge monthly fees ($25-50K minimum) because clients get ongoing value from their workflows. Production must deliver against client workflow agreements (e.g., 3-day turnaround) to prove the model works. High request volume + on-time delivery = retention + expansion. Enterprise buyers expect predictability; acquirers and investors care about margins.

GOAL

Achieve 50% production margin, 90%+ on-time delivery against workflow SLAs, and growing client platform engagement.

OUTCOMES

| Outcome | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Production Margin | 40% | 45% | 48% | 50% | Wayan |
| On-Time Delivery vs. Workflow SLA | 80% | 85% | 90% | 90%+ | Wayan |
| Client job requests submitted (platform) | Baseline | +25% | +50% | +75% | Wayan |
| Client NPS Score (collected by Sales) | Baseline | 40+ | 45+ | 50+ | Ben |

## NPS Measurement

NPS ownership is with Sales as part of deal closeout and re-engagement process. Production delivers the data (Closing Report); Sales collects the score.

TBD — Ben and Wayan to align on cadence and method by end of Q1:

- Relationship-level (quarterly)?

- Workflow-level (per new workflow deployed)?

- Job-level (per deliverable)?

# WhyGO #3: Scale Production Capacity With Revenue

WHY

Each client pod requires a Producer. Pod 1 (Generative core team) is fully staffed as a fixed cost. Additional Producers, AI Generalists, and Preditors are funded by new revenue ($25-50K/month per enterprise client). Production must scale capacity in lockstep with client growth—not ahead, not behind. The target client-to-producer ratio is 4:1, but the actual sustainable ratio is unknown and must be discovered.

GOAL

Scale Production capacity to support 20 clients by adding Producers proportional to revenue, while discovering and optimizing the sustainable client-to-producer ratio.

OUTCOMES

| Outcome | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Producers on team | 3 | 4 | 5 | 5-6 | Wayan |
| Client-to-Producer ratio (actual) | Baseline | Track | Track | Target 4:1 | Wayan |
| Producer onboarding time (hire → independent) | Baseline | 4 weeks | 3 weeks | 3 weeks | Wayan |
| Producer job description & hiring criteria documented | Done | — | — | — | Wayan |

## Pod Structure

Each client pod consists of:

| Role | Department | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Account Manager | Sales | Client relationship, renewals, upsells, NPS collection |
| Producer | Production | Execution management, handoffs, delivery, closing reports |
| Generative Pod | Generative | Workflow Engineer, AI Generalist, Preditor, Data/LoRA Specialist |

## Hiring Trigger

New Producer hired when:

- Revenue supports the role (margin positive)

- Existing Producers exceed sustainable ratio

- Client growth pipeline is confirmed

# Addendum A: Cross-Departmental Dependencies

The Production Department does not operate in isolation. Success depends on coordination with Sales, Generative, and Platform.

## Dependencies ON Production (What Others Need From Wayan's Team)

| Department | Dependency | Production Delivers | Timeline |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sales (Ben) | Proof points for enterprise sales | Closing Reports, case study packages | Per project |
| Generative (Fill) | Clear execution briefs | Pod requests with 1-week lead time, brand context | Per project |
| Platform (Niels) | Tool requirements | Production Management feedback, adoption data | Monthly |
| Executive | Operational visibility | Weekly margin/delivery dashboard, escalation flags | Weekly |

## Dependencies FROM Production (What Wayan's Team Needs From Others)

| Department | Dependency | Deliverable Needed | Success Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sales (Ben) | Complete deal handoff | SOW package within 48 hrs of signature | 100% compliance |
| Generative (Fill) | QC-passed assets | First-pass quality deliverables | ≥85% pass rate |
| Generative (Fill) | Capacity signals | Availability response within 24 hrs | 100% compliance |
| Platform (Niels) | Production Management tools | MVP fully in use for handoff tracking | Q1 |
| Platform (Niels) | Client Portal | Job request submission workflow | Q3 |

# Addendum B: Progress Tracking

## Progress Indicators

| Indicator | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| [+] | On pace to achieve 100% of goal |
| [~] | Slightly off-pace, within 20% |
| [-] | Off-pace, more than 20% behind |

## Review Cadence

| Cadence | Activity |
| --- | --- |
| Weekly | Leadership sync: pacing check on all WhyGOs, identify blockers |
| Monthly | Full dashboard review with actuals vs. quarterly targets |
| Quarterly | Board review, outcome recalibration if needed, compensation linkage review |

## The Through-Line

Everything ladders to one sentence:

Make Kartel operationally inevitable, not hero-dependent.
