# Executive Summary

The Generative Department is the technical engine that powers Kartel's Creative Intelligence Infrastructure. In 2026, the department will focus on three strategic priorities that directly enable company growth:

- Role Definition & Scale Readiness: Document every role with playbooks, load-test pod capacity, and discover how many concurrent clients one Generative pod can serve before scaling to Pod 2.

- Technical Excellence & R&D: Stay at the cutting edge of AI through systematic R&D, establish QC processes that measure bulk run success, and maintain the accuracy standards that solve the 70% Problem.

- Generative Platform Expansion: Build the Internal Enterprise Platform, Community Ecosystem Platform, and Kartel Labs tools that multiply team capacity and enable the Talent Engine.

These WhyGOs ladder directly to Company WhyGOs #2 (Operational Excellence), #3 (Talent Engine), and #4 (Enterprise Platform). Success in the Generative Department unlocks Kartel's ability to scale without linear headcount growth.

# Company WhyGO Alignment

| Department WhyGO | Ladders To | Connection |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #1: Role Definition & Scale Readiness | Company #2 + #3 | Strong |
| #2: Technical Excellence & R&D | Company #2 | Strong |
| #3: Generative Platform Expansion | Company #3 + #4 | Strong |

# WhyGO #1: Role Definition & Scale Readiness

| WHY
Kartel scales by deploying complete pods to enterprise clients—not individual hires. Each pod needs a Workflow Engineer, AI Generalist, Preditor, and Data/LoRA specialist working in sync. The core capability is building custom workflows on custom-trained data, then outputting content at scale while feeding approved outputs back into training data to continuously improve accuracy. If roles aren't clearly defined and this cycle isn't documented, we can't replicate the team—and every new client engagement becomes a scramble instead of a deployment. Critically, we must also discover how many concurrent clients one Generative pod can handle before we need to scale to Pod 2. |
| --- |

| GOAL
Every Generative team role is documented with a written playbook that is reviewed and approved as onboarding-ready, with pod capacity load-tested through real or pro-bono projects by end of Q1, and maximum concurrent client capacity per pod discovered and documented by EOY. |
| --- |

### OUTCOMES

| Outcome | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Role Playbooks completed (5 roles) | 2 | 4 | 5 | 5 | Fill |
| Playbooks reviewed & approved as onboarding ready | 1 | 3 | 5 | 5 | Fill |
| Pod capacity load-tested (full cycle: workflow → LoRA → output → feedback) | Tested | Validated | Optimized | Documented | Fill |
| Max concurrent clients per Gen pod (discovered) | Test | Baseline | Validated | Documented | Fill |

### Role Tracks to Document

- Workflow Engineer (Trent, Ahmed)

- AI Generalist (Elliot)

- Preditor (Marc)

- Data/LoRA Specialist (Brandon)

- Data Engineer (Sean)

### Load Test Projects & Pod Capacity Discovery

Pod capacity will be established through real work—passion projects, pro-bono engagements for culturally relevant brands, charities, causes, or big cultural moments. The goal is to run the full production cycle (custom workflow → LoRA training → content output → performance feedback → model optimization) without waiting for paying clients.

Discovery Question: How many concurrent clients can one Generative pod serve before we need Pod 2? This directly informs Production's scaling model and hiring decisions.

# WhyGO #2: Technical Excellence & R&D

| WHY
The AI landscape evolves faster than any other space. What's cutting-edge today is outdated in months. The Generative team must stay ahead of the curve—systematically evaluating new tools, models, and techniques—so every deliverable uses the best available technology. Our competitive advantage is solving the 70% Problem through custom workflows and custom-trained models. Maintaining accuracy requires robust QC processes that measure bulk run success rates and continuous model optimization through the feedback loop. |
| --- |

| GOAL
Maintain technical leadership through systematic R&D, robust QC processes measuring bulk output success rates, and LoRA evaluation standards that support the 70% → 100% accuracy promise. |
| --- |

### OUTCOMES

| Outcome | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QC process documented and in use (bulk run success + visual standards) | Done | — | — | — | Fill |
| R&D reports (team explores, Fill synthesizes) | 3 | 6 | 9 | 12 | Fill |
| LoRA Eval tool deployed and integrated | MVP | v1.0 | Optimized | — | Fill |
| Bulk run success rate (≥1 client-worthy output per batch) | Baseline | TBD | TBD | TBD | Fill |

### QC Measurement Framework

- Bulk Run Success: Per prompt, if we generate X outputs, success = at least 1 meets visual standard for client delivery

- LoRA Eval: Testing grid validates model against training goals before deployment

- Visual Standard Sample: Each workflow has a reference benchmark for pass/fail

- Target Setting: Baseline established Q1 through load testing; targets set once data exists

### R&D Process

When new tools/models emerge (e.g., 5 new image models released), Fill assigns one to each team member to analyze and report. Each person explores their assigned technology and provides findings. Fill compiles and synthesizes into monthly R&D reports.

# WhyGO #3: Generative Platform Expansion & Adoption

| WHY
Kartel can't scale by adding headcount for every new client. The Generative Platform is how we multiply capacity. The Internal Enterprise Platform gives Generative and Production teams custom tools that accelerate their workflow. The Community Ecosystem Platform powers Daniel's Talent Engine—enabling generation credits, challenges, and the certification pipeline that attracts and retains talent. Kartel Labs is where the team builds vibe-coded internal tools that optimize their own jobs and prepare them to onboard Pod 2, compounding efficiency over time. |
| --- |

| GOAL
Expand the Generative Platform across three pillars—Internal Enterprise tools, Community Ecosystem infrastructure (with Niels), and Kartel Labs internal tool development—with monthly Demo Days and adoption across Generative, Production, and Community teams. |
| --- |

### OUTCOMES

| Outcome | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Internal Enterprise Platform: Key use cases (LoRA, captioning, curation, chat) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Fill |
| Community Ecosystem Platform: Core features live | MVP | v1.0 | Iterate | Validated | Fill + Niels |
| Platform adopted into standard workflow | — | Gen | + Prod | + Comm | Fill |
| Kartel Labs: Team-built tools (optimize role + Pod 2 onboarding) | 2 | 4 | 5 | 6 | Fill + Team |
| Monthly Kartel Labs Demo Day | 3 | 6 | 9 | 12 | Fill |

### Platform Architecture

| Component | 2026 Priority | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Internal Enterprise Platform | Critical | Core production tools for Generative + Production teams |
| Community Ecosystem Platform | Critical | Powers Talent Engine: credits, challenges, certification |
| Kartel Labs | Active | Internal tool optimization + R&D sandbox |

### Kartel Labs Contribution Model

Each Generative team member builds vibe-coded projects that: (a) optimize their specific job function, and (b) assist in onboarding their role for Pod 2. These become shared tools for the team and demonstrate role mastery. Monthly Demo Days showcase new capabilities and create institutional knowledge.

# Addendum A: Cross-Departmental Dependencies

The Generative Department does not operate in isolation. Success depends on coordination with Production, Community, Platform, and Sales. This section maps the critical dependencies and handoffs.

### Dependencies on Generative (Who depends on Fill's team)

| Department | Dependency | Fill Deliverable | Timeline |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Community (Daniel) | Platform for credits, challenges, tier progression | Community Ecosystem MVP | Q1 |
| Community (Daniel) | Defined roles for Tier 5 talent placement | Role Playbooks | Q1-Q3 |
| Production (Wayan) | QC-passed assets that don't require rework | QC Process + Bulk Run Success | Q1+ |
| Executive | Capacity data for scaling/hiring decisions | Pod Capacity Baseline + Max Clients Discovery | Q1-Q4 |
| Sales (Ben) | Pitch demos and proof-of-concept capabilities | Kartel Labs Experiments | On-demand |

### Dependencies from Generative (What Fill's team needs)

| Department | Dependency | Deliverable | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Platform (Niels) | Infrastructure for Community Platform | Backend/Frontend Dev | Niels |
| Community (Daniel) | Qualified Tier 4 talent ready for deployment | Talent Pipeline | Daniel |
| Production (Wayan) | Client feedback and performance analytics | Feedback Loop Data | Wayan |
| Sales (Ben) | New client briefs and problem sets | Client Pipeline | Ben |

### Talent Engine: The Daniel → Fill Handoff

Company WhyGO #3 requires 20 Tier 5 Approved Kartel Talent deployed on client work by EOY. This outcome depends on clear handoff between Community and Generative:

| Stage | Owner | Responsibility | Success Criteria |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tiers 1-4 | Daniel (Community) | Recruit, train, certify talent to role-specific standards | Talent passes challenges, completes certification |
| Tier 4→5 Handoff | Daniel + Fill | Qualified talent matched to open roles | Talent assigned to specific pod/role |
| Tier 5 | Fill (Generative) | Deploy, manage, maximize output | Talent producing client work at quality standards |

Fill's role playbooks enable this handoff. Without documented roles, Daniel can't certify talent to the right standards, and Fill can't onboard them efficiently.
