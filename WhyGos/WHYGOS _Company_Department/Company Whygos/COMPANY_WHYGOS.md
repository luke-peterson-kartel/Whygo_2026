## WhyGO #1: Prove Product-Market Fit Across Verticals

### WHY

Enterprise clients require custom AI models and workflows to achieve 100% brand accuracy - generic tools only deliver 70%. Proving our Creative Intelligence Infrastructure works across multiple verticals demonstrates market demand, validates our thesis, and creates referenceable case studies for growth. Client count and vertical diversity matter more than revenue at this stage.

### GOAL

Onboard 10 enterprise clients across 5 key verticals by end of Q2 2026, establishing Kartel as the category leader in Creative Intelligence Infrastructure.

### OUTCOMES

| # | Outcome | Annual | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Owner |
|---|---------|--------|----|----|----|----|-------|
| 1 | Enterprise clients signed (total) | 10+ | 4 | 10 | 14 | 18+ | Ben |
| 2 | Verticals with 2+ clients (CPG, Auto, Beauty/Fashion, eComm, Real Estate) | 5 | 2 | 5 | 5 | 5 | Kevin |
| 3 | Client case studies published | 5 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 5 | Marketing |

## WhyGO #2: Build Operational Excellence

### WHY

As we scale client engagements, operational consistency becomes critical. Clients are buying infrastructure, not one-off projects - they expect a premier experience with predictable quality, on-time delivery, and healthy margins. Strong operations also create the data foundation for continuous improvement and demonstrates the maturity acquirers and investors expect.

### GOAL

Establish operational infrastructure that delivers premier client experience with 50% production margin, 90%+ on-time delivery, and world-class client satisfaction.

### OUTCOMES

| # | Outcome | Annual | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Owner |
|---|---------|--------|----|----|----|----|-------|
| 1 | Production Margin | 50% | 40% | 45% | 48% | 50% | Luke |
| 2 | On-Time Delivery Rate | 90%+ | 80% | 85% | 90% | 90%+ | Fill |
| 3 | Client NPS Score | 50+ | Baseline | 40+ | 45+ | 50+ | Ops Lead |

### NPS Measurement Protocol

## WhyGO #3: Build the Talent Engine

### WHY

Kartel's ability to scale is constrained by access to creative engineering talent - a skillset that barely exists in the market. By building a community and training pipeline, we create a sustainable talent moat: a roster of pre-vetted, Kartel-trained engineers ready to deploy on client work. This is cheaper than full-time hiring, faster than recruiting, and builds brand equity in the generative AI community.

### GOAL

Build Discord community to 1,000 members with a 5-tier talent pipeline, culminating in 20 approved Kartel Talent actively working on client engagements.

### OUTCOMES

| # | Outcome | Annual | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Owner |
|---|---------|--------|----|----|----|----|-------|
| 1 | Discord Community Members | 1,000 | 300 | 500 | 750 | 1,000 | Community |
| 2 | Tier 5: Approved Kartel Talent (deployed on client work) | 20 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | Fill |
| 3 | Roles covered (Workflow Eng, AI Generalist, Data Spec, Training Spec, Preditor) | 5/5 | 3/5 | 4/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | Community |

### Talent Tier Definitions

| Tier | Status | Criteria |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Tier 1** | Community Member | Joined Discord, completed onboarding |
| **Tier 2** | Engaged Learner | Completed foundational training modules, active in community |
| **Tier 3** | Skill Verified | Passed technical assessment in one or more role tracks |
| **Tier 4** | Trial Contributor | Completed supervised trial project with quality review |

## WhyGO #4: Deploy Enterprise Platform

### WHY

Current operations rely on manual coordination. To scale beyond early clients without linear headcount growth, we need platform infrastructure across three pillars: client-facing portal, internal production management, and generative tooling layer. This platform is critical IP that demonstrates enterprise readiness and creates switching costs.

### GOAL

Deploy the three-pillar Enterprise Platform (Client Portal, Production Management, Generative Platform) to support 10+ concurrent client engagements.

### OUTCOMES

| # | Outcome | Annual | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Owner |
|---|---------|--------|----|----|----|----|-------|
| 1 | Client Portal: Job requests, data upload, asset delivery, admin | Live | Spec | MVP | v1.0 | Iterate | Platform |
| 2 | Production Management: Jobs, milestones, resources, expense tracking | Live | Spec | MVP | v1.0 | Iterate | Platform |
| 3 | Generative Platform: Workflows, LoRA training, client data, media gen | Live | MVP | v1.0 | v1.5 | v2.0 | Fill |

### Platform Architecture

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pillar 1: Client Portal** | Enterprise admin interface for job requests, data infrastructure, asset delivery, user management |
| **Pillar 2: Production Management** | Internal platform for managing client jobs, milestones, team resource allocation, expense tracking, timeline management |
| **Pillar 3: Generative Platform** | Internal tooling for ComfyUI workflows, custom LoRA/model training, client data access, media generation for client deliverables |
