## Slide 4: How It Works

  1. Person → Computer (You update)
  2. Gears/Automation (System calculates)
  3. Dashboard (Everyone sees status)

### Text

**3 Simple Steps:**

1. **You update** (Monday mornings)
   - Record your actuals
   - Takes 5-10 minutes

2. **System calculates** (automatic)
   - Compares actual vs target
   - Assigns status: [+] [~] [-]

3. **Everyone sees** (real-time)
   - Company dashboard
   - Department views
   - Personal views

## Slide 5: Status Indicators

### Visual

  - 🟢 [+] On pace
  - 🟡 [~] Slightly off
  - 🔴 [-] Off pace

### Text

**Automatic Status Calculation:**

🟢 **[+] On pace** - 100%+ of target
*You're crushing it*

🟡 **[~] Slightly off** - 80-99% of target
*Minor adjustment needed*

🔴 **[-] Off pace** - Below 80% of target
*Time to course-correct*

*Status updates automatically. You just record the numbers.*
